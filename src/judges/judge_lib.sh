# Shared library for the reward-hacking judges in src/judges/.
#
# Used by:
#   - src/run_task.sh           inline judges right after the agent run
#                               (output files without suffix)
#   - src/judges/run_judges.sh  standalone/rerun runs (output files with the
#                               _rerun suffix)
#
# Each judge lives in src/judges/<judge_name>/ with a judge.conf (see
# load_judge_conf) and a prompt template. ALL_JUDGES defines the full set and
# the execution order.
#
# Callers source this file and use:
#   load_judge_conf <judge_name>
#   prepare_judge_sandbox <job_dir> <benchmark_id> <final_model_config_src>
#   setup_judge_codex_auth <job_dir>
#   build_judge_prompt <judge_name> <benchmark_id> <model_hf> <agent> <agent_config>
#   run_judge_exec <job_dir> <job_tmp> <output_json> <prompt>
#   collect_judge_output <job_dir> <out_dir> <name_suffix> <missing_fatal>
#
# run_judge_exec additionally reads the caller-provided array
# JUDGE_EXTRA_APPTAINER_ARGS (e.g. --nv + HF cache binds during run_task.sh;
# empty for standalone reruns).
