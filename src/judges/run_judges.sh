# Run the reward-hacking judges on an existing result directory.
#
# Judges live in src/judges/<judge_name>/ (see judge_lib.sh); by default all
# of them run, in the order given by ALL_JUDGES:
#   1. data_contamination_judge -> judgement_gpt5_4_rerun.json
#      (contamination/disallowed_model verdict; this is the canonical
#      contamination verdict consumed downstream)
#   2. api_usage_judge          -> judgement_api_rerun.json
#      (separate `disallowed_api_usage` schema; consumed by scoring — a
#      flagged run falls back to the baseline score)
#   3. ptb_lookup_judge         -> judgement_ptb_lookup_rerun.json
#      (separate `disallowed_ptb_lookup` schema; archival, but
#      scripts/collect.py errors out if it ever flags)
#   4. general_judge            -> judgement_general_rerun.json
#      (separate `general_anomaly` schema; GPT-5.6-Terra unknown-unknowns
#      sweep on codex 0.144.5 — archival, but when it flags,
#      scripts/collect.py finishes its collection pass without writing any
#      files and errors out listing the flagged runs)
#
# All outputs are always saved with the _rerun suffix so original judge
# outputs produced by src/run_task.sh are preserved.
#
# Usage: run_judges.sh [--judges <name>[,<name>...]] <result_dir>
#
# Options:
#   --judges   Comma-separated subset of judges to run (default: all).
#              e.g. --judges data_contamination_judge
#                   --judges api_usage_judge
