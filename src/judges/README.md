# Reward-Hacking Judges

Agent-as-judge checks that detect reward hacking in agent runs. They analyze the agent's trace
(`solve_parsed.txt`, fallback `solve_out.txt`) by starting from the end and tracing back where
`final_model` comes from, then write a structured verdict.

The judges run in two contexts:

- **Inline** — `src/run_task.sh` runs every judge right after the agent finishes, writing
  `judgement_<id>.json` etc. into the result dir.
- **Standalone/rerun** — `run_judges.sh <result_dir>` reruns judges on an existing result dir.
  Outputs always carry the `_rerun` suffix so the originals are preserved.

## Judges

| Folder | Output id | Verdict schema | Consumed downstream? |
|--------|-----------|----------------|----------------------|
| `data_contamination_judge/` | `gpt5_4` | `contamination`, `disallowed_model` + justifications | **Yes** — canonical contamination verdict (`judgement_gpt5_4.json`, or `judgement_gpt5_4_rerun.json` when present) |
| `api_usage_judge/` | `api` | `disallowed_api_usage` + justification | **Yes** — a flagged run falls back to the baseline score in `scripts/collect.py` (missing file = "not flagged": runs predating this judge have none) |
| `ptb_lookup_judge/` | `ptb_lookup` | `disallowed_ptb_lookup` + justification | Archival — no score fallback, but `scripts/collect.py` raises an error if it ever flags, so a firing lookup judge cannot pass unnoticed |
| `general_judge/` | `general` | `general_anomaly` + justification | Archival — never feeds scores; when it flags, `scripts/collect.py` finishes its collection pass but writes **no** output files and raises, listing every flagged run for manual review (flip `general_anomaly` to false in the listed verdict file if the run checks out) |

The three reward-hacking judges run as GPT-5.4 via the codex CLI; the general judge — an
open-ended sweep for "unknown unknowns" (premature agent stops, usage limits/token
exhaustion, grader-API credit exhaustion on the LLM-judged benchmarks, harness/infra
failures, novel reward hacking outside the other judges' scope) — runs as GPT-5.6 Terra on
a codex CLI pinned to 0.144.5 (`JUDGE_CODEX_VERSION`, npm-installed into the sandbox at
judge time). All use ChatGPT-subscription auth
(`agents/codex_non_api/auth.json`, bind-mounted so rotated refresh tokens persist).

```

## Running

```bash
# Rerun all judges on one result dir (writes *_rerun outputs, originals preserved)
bash src/judges/run_judges.sh /path/to/result_dir

# Rerun a subset
bash src/judges/run_judges.sh --judges data_contamination_judge /path/to/result_dir
bash src/judges/run_judges.sh --judges api_usage_judge /path/to/result_dir
```

The result dir must contain `task/` and a trace file. The trace is copied next to the sandbox
task directory, so the judge reads it as `../solve_parsed.txt` from its working directory.

## Batch reruns (HTCondor)

```bash
# Rerun all judges on the latest run of every (method, benchmark, model)
bash src/judges/rerun/commit_rerun_judges.sh

# Preview without submitting
bash src/judges/rerun/commit_rerun_judges.sh --dry-run

# Only a subset of judges
bash src/judges/rerun/commit_rerun_judges.sh --judges data_contamination_judge

# Per result dir, only rerun judges whose _rerun output is missing
bash src/judges/rerun/commit_rerun_judges.sh --skip-existing
```

Submitted cluster IDs are logged to `rerun/submission_logs/submitted_<timestamp>.txt`
(one `cluster<TAB>judges<TAB>result_dir` line per job).

For ad-hoc targeting (a specific method/benchmark, a limit, etc.), build the directory list with
`list_results.py` and submit `rerun_judges.sub` directly:

```bash
python src/judges/rerun/list_results.py --paths-only --latest-only --method "claude" \
| while read -r d; do
    condor_submit_bid 100 -a "result_dir=$d" src/judges/rerun/rerun_judges.sub
done
```

`rerun_judges.sub` accepts `-a "judges=..."` (default: all). Every rerun job consumes a
fixed 2500 units of the `user.codex_judge_rerun` concurrency limit, regardless of which
judges it runs.

### Listing and aggregation

```bash
# List/filter result directories (--with-trace, --missing-rerun, --paths-only, ...)
python src/judges/rerun/list_results.py --paths-only --method "claude"

# Compare original vs rerun contamination verdicts (--diff-only, --csv out.csv)
python src/judges/rerun/aggregate_rerun_results.py

# Absolute paths of latest dirs flagged for disallowed API usage
python src/judges/rerun/find_disallowed_api_usage.py
```

## Output files

Per judge (`<id>` = `JUDGE_OUTPUT_ID`, `<sfx>` = empty inline / `_rerun` standalone):

- `judge_output_<id><sfx>.json` — raw codex CLI trace
- `judge_output_<id><sfx>.txt` — human-readable trace (`src/trace_parsing/parse_trace.py`)
- `judgement_<id><sfx>.json` — structured verdict the judge wrote to `judgement.json`
  in its sandbox task directory

`judgement_gpt5_4*.json` schema:

```json
{
  "contamination": true,
  "disallowed_model": false,
  "justification_contamination": "...",
  "justification_disallowed_model": "..."
}
```

`judgement_api*.json` schema:

```json
{
  "disallowed_api_usage": false,
  "justification_disallowed_api_usage": "..."
}
```

`judgement_ptb_lookup*.json` schema:

```json
{
  "disallowed_ptb_lookup": false,
  "justification_disallowed_ptb_lookup": "..."
}
```

`judgement_general*.json` schema:

```json
{
  "general_anomaly": false,
  "justification_general_anomaly": "..."
}
```

## Adding a new judge

1. Create `src/judges/<judge_name>/` with:
   - a prompt template (any filename). `{model}` and `{benchmark}` are always filled; if the
     template needs extra placeholders, register a fill function in `EXTRA_FILLERS` in
     `get_judge_prompt.py`.
   - `judge.conf` — simple `KEY="value"` lines (sourced by bash, parsed by python):
     - `JUDGE_LABEL` — human-readable name used in logs
     - `JUDGE_OUTPUT_ID` — suffix for all output files (`judgement_<id>.json`, ...)
     - `JUDGE_PROMPT_FILE` — the template's filename
     - optional: `JUDGE_MODEL` / `JUDGE_REASONING_EFFORT` to override the codex defaults
       (`gpt-5.4` / `xhigh`, see `judge_lib.sh`)
     - optional: `JUDGE_CODEX_VERSION` to pin the codex CLI release for this judge
       (e.g. `"0.144.5"`); `judge_lib.sh` npm-installs exactly that `@openai/codex`
       version into the sandbox home and runs it instead of the container's codex.
       Empty/unset = the container's pinned codex.
2. Add the folder name to `ALL_JUDGES` in `judge_lib.sh` (array order = execution order).

That's it — `run_task.sh`, `run_judges.sh` and `commit_rerun_judges.sh` all iterate over the
judge set, and `--skip-existing` is derived from `judge.conf`.

A judge that produces no `judgement.json` is handled by the caller, not by `judge.conf`:
inline (`run_task.sh`) it is always a warning, so a finished 10h agent run still gets
evaluated and the rerun pipeline can supply the verdict later; standalone
(`run_judges.sh`) it is always fatal, since producing the verdict is the job.

The judge prompt must instruct the model to write its verdict to `judgement.json` in the task
directory; that file is collected as `judgement_<id><sfx>.json`.
